Change Component Description : Designator=PWM1 Old Description=This discrete MOSFET H-bridge motor driver enables bidirectional control of one high-power DC brushed motor. The small 1.3? × 0.8? board supports a wide 6.5 V to 40 V voltage range and is efficient enough to deliver a continuous 21 A without a heat sink. Additional features of this second-generation (G2) driver include reverse-voltage protection along with basic current sensing and current limiting functionality.
